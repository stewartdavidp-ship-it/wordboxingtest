MOBILE-FIRST UI REDESIGN
------------------------
Complete redesign of lobby screen for mobile PWA:

- Removed standalone title - integrated into lobby
- Compact "WordBoxing" header (no emoji clutter)
- Reduced padding and spacing throughout
- Smaller, tighter buttons
- Simplified labels: "Pass & Play" instead of long text
- Removed distracting emojis from buttons
- Cleaner dividers: "online" / "local" 
- Leaderboard button with outline style (less prominent)
- Proper safe-area support for notch/Dynamic Island

The layout now fits comfortably on mobile screens without
excessive scrolling or wasted space.
