MOBILE PWA UI FIX
-----------------
Fixed layout issues when running as PWA on mobile:

- Added safe-area-inset support for notch/Dynamic Island
- Removed yellow border from menu button
- Made Sign In button more compact
- Fixed title positioning (no longer overlaps with header buttons)
- Moved boxing glove emoji to beginning of title
- Added responsive font sizing for smaller screens
- Proper spacing for all fixed header elements

The app now properly respects iOS safe areas and has a cleaner
mobile-first layout suitable for PWA usage.
